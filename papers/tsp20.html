This paper considers the problem of sequential binary hypothesis testing based on observations from a network of m sensors where a subset of the sensors is compromised by a malicious adversary. The asymptotic average sample number required to reach a certain level of error probability is selected as the performance metric of the system. We propose an asymptotically optimal voting algorithm for the sensor network with a fusion center and generalize it to fully-distributed networks, where the algorithm stays asymptotically optimal under the weak assumption that the sensor network is connected. Moreover, we prove that both of the proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimal in the presence of Byzantine sensors, in the sense that each of them forms a Nash equilibrium with the worst-case attack (flip-attack). Compared to existing distributed detection strategies, the proposed scheme has a low message complexity, which is independent of the error probability and the sample number, by taking advantage of the sparsity of votes. The results are corroborated by numerical simulations.
